Output:
Maximum Obtainable Value is 22
Considering the above implementation, following is recursion tree for a Rod of length 4.

cR() ---> cutRod() 

                             cR(4)
                  /        /           
                 /        /              
             cR(3)       cR(2)     cR(1)   cR(0)
            /  |         /         |
           /   |        /          |  
      cR(2) cR(1) cR(0) cR(1) cR(0) cR(0)
     /        |          |
    /         |          |   
  cR(1) cR(0) cR(0)      cR(0)
   /
 /
CR(0)
In the above partial recursion tree, cR(2) is being solved twice. We can see that there are many subproblems which are solved again and again. Since same suproblems are called again, this problem has Overlapping Subprolems property. So the Rod Cutting problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array val[] in bottom up manner.
